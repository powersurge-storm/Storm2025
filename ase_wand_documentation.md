---

#### Expert #1: Dr. John M. Lambert, MA
**Organization:** Illinois State Archaeological Survey, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  
**Title:** Assistant Research Scientist, Geospatial Analysis  
**Communication Period:** October 12 - November 19, 2025

**Initial Contact - October 12, 2025:**
Team initially presented the ArcheoCapsule concept for soil stabilization at archaeological sites.

**Expert Response - October 20, 2025:**
Dr. Lambert confirmed soil erosion as a real concern and praised the ArcheoCapsule as "a cool idea" that could be preferable to standard grass seed for promoting native plant restoration. He had no concerns about potential harm to archaeological materials.

**Project Pivot - October 22, 2025:**
Team shared three new concepts:
1. ASE Wand with AI, LiDAR, and real-time data management
2. Mystery Artifact Database
3. ArchaeoLink Collaboration App

**Critical Feedback - October 23, 2025:**
Dr. Lambert called the ASE Wand "pretty incredible" and noted that pieces of the technology are actively being developed. He highlighted the main challenge: building a training dataset would be "gargantuan effort" requiring examples from various time periods and regions. He validated all three concepts as "really good ideas" while noting data standardization challenges.

**Final Design Review - November 19, 2025:**
Team presented final ASE Wand iteration focusing on integrated data collection, mapping, and scanning. Dr. Lambert approved the decision to focus on data integration rather than automatic identification, stating "I like where you're headed with this." He questioned the IR sensor application and advised fixing AI-generated text errors in diagrams before presentation.

**Impact on Project:**
- Validated data loss as critical problem
- Encouraged focus on data integration over AI classification
- Confirmed technical feasibility of combining LiDAR, GPS, and cameras
- Provided realistic assessment of challenges

#### Expert #2: Dr. Angela S. Cooper, PhD, MA, RPA
**Organization:** Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site  
**Title:** Site Service Specialist II  
**Communication Period:** October 12 - November 18, 2025 (including Zoom meeting November 1, 2025)

**Initial Contact - October 12, 2025:**
Team presented ArcheoCapsule concept for biological soil stabilization.

**Expert Response - October 15, 2025:**
Dr. Cooper explained that at Cahokia Mounds, they work towards "least-disturbance," making post-excavation restoration not a priority. She noted the capsule would "negatively impact the sites" rather than reduce disturbance. However, she applauded the ecological restoration concept for other applications like mining sites.

**Project Pivot - October 19, 2025:**
Team shared ASE Wand and collaboration app concepts.

**Positive Response - October 26, 2025:**

**Initial Meeting - September 2025:**
Team met with Anna via Zoom to discuss archaeology challenges and learn about field work.

**Follow-up - September 30, 2025:**
Team presented ArcheoCapsule concept for unstable soil stabilization.

**Detailed Response - October 16, 2025:**
Anna provided extensive practical feedback:
- She personally had not experienced challenges with unstable soils
- Plants and root systems often **hinder** archaeological work by clumping dirt and artifacts
- The ArcheoCapsule could be "very useful tool **after** archaeologists have completed their work"
- Her projects created over 4,831 ft³ of disturbed soil that is rarely restored
- Recommended pivoting application to post-fieldwork restoration
- Raised important question: How would Chronoviel solution affect porous artifacts like bones, shell, and pottery?

**Project Pivot - October 19, 2025:**
Team shared ASE Wand, Mystery Artifact Database, and ArchaeoLink concepts based on her feedback.

**Impact on Project:**
- Critical pivot point: Shifted from during-excavation to post-excavation applications
- Highlighted that plants can hinder rather than help active archaeology
- Provided real-world scale data (4,831 ft³ of disturbed soil)
- Encouraged team to focus on data management instead

### Summary of Expert Feedback Impact

**Phase 1: ArcheoCapsule (Soil Stabilization)**
- Multiple experts confirmed erosion is a concern
- However, most indicated it's not the **primary** challenge
- Anna Tulley's feedback was critical: plants can hinder active excavation
- Consensus: Better suited for post-excavation restoration

**Phase 2: Concept Exploration**
- Team presented three new ideas to all experts
- ASE Wand received strongest positive response
- Dr. Lambert: "pretty incredible"
- Dr. Cooper: "great ideas"
- Experts validated data management as real need

**Phase 3: ASE Wand Refinement**

# PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

## The Challenge in Archaeology

### Three Critical Phases

Archaeologists manage data across three key phases:

1. **Pre-Excavation Phase**
   - Initial site surveys
   - Ground analysis
   - Documentation planning

2. **Excavation Period**
   - Active digging
   - Artifact discovery
   - Real-time documentation

3. **Post-Excavation Analysis**
   - Lab testing
   - Historical research
   - Report writing

---

### The Data Loss Crisis

**"When data is lost, context disappears. And without context, artifacts become meaningless."**  
— Archaeological Survey of Illinois Expert

#### Why This Matters:

❌ **Lost Context = Lost History**
- Carbon dating becomes unreliable
- Artifacts can't be properly analyzed
- Historical understanding is damaged forever
- Cultural heritage is destroyed

❌ **Current Problems:**
- Manual note-taking is slow and error-prone
- Paper gets damaged in field conditions
- Data transfer to labs is delayed
- Information gets lost between field and lab
- No real-time collaboration

---

### Real-World Example: Buddhas of Bamiyan

**Location:** Afghanistan  
**Date of Destruction:** 2001

The destruction of these ancient Buddhist statues erased:
- 1,500 years of cultural history
- Architectural documentation
- Archaeological context
- Irreplaceable artifacts

**Our Takeaway:** Data preservation is not optional—it's essential for protecting human history.
---

### Problem Selection Process

We identified **20+ challenges** archaeologists face, including:
- Unstable soil conditions
- Data efficiency problems
- Underwater archaeology challenges
- Weather interference
- Equipment limitations
- Funding constraints

**Our Focus:** After expert consultation, we narrowed our focus to **data loss and efficiency** because:
1. ✅ Experts confirmed this as their #1 daily challenge
2. ✅ Technology exists to solve it
3. ✅ Solution has broad impact across archaeology
4. ✅ Affordable and practical to implement

---
