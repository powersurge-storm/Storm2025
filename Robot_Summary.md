## 🔧 SIX MULTI-USE ATTACHMENTS | 15 MISSIONS

| # | Attachment | Missions Served | Points | Success | Key Innovation |
|---|------------|-----------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Surface + Map** | Surface Brushing, Map Reveal | 60 | 92% | Passive + Active combo |
| 2 | **Scales + Sale** | Tip Scales, What's On Sale, Market | 90 | 89% | 3-mission capability |
| 3 | **Forge + Lift** | Forge, Heavy Lifting, Who Lived | 90 | 87% | Variable height lift |
| 4 | **Sand + Ship** | Sand, Ship Explorer | 30+ | 91% | Dual-action sweep |
| 5 | **Explorer + Statue** | Mineshaft, Statue Rebuild | 60-70 | 85% | Motor-driven precision |
| 6 | **Angler** | Angler Artifacts | 30 | 95% | Perfect hook geometry |

**Philosophy:** One attachment serves 2-3 missions → **6 attachments vs. 15 separate tools (60% reduction)**

**Evolution:** 49 total design iterations | 376 attachment tests | 75 tests per attachment average

## 💻 PYTHON PROGRAMMING: 5 STRATEGIC RUNS

```python
# Standardized Code Structure (All 5 Runs)
async def main():
    # Setup: Gyro reset, motor pairing
    motion_sensor.reset_yaw(0)
    motor_pair.pair(motor_pair.PAIR_1, port.B, port.D)
    
    # Mission sequence with sensor verification
    await mission_1()  # Flows seamlessly
    await mission_2()  # No stop-restart
    await mission_3()  # Sensor checkpoints
    
    # Return to base
```

**Code Organization:** 
- **Run 1** (Saanvika, Darshan): Surface + Map
- **Run 2** (Mansi, Sana): Forge + Lift + Who Lived  
- **Run 3** (Vihaan): Mineshaft + Statue
- **Run 4** (Anavi, Sharman): Scales + Sale + Market
- **Run 5** (Shrihan, Amelia): Sand + Ship + Angler

**Shared Library:** Reusable movement, sensor, and attachment functions | 60% code reuse achieved

**Key Improvements After Testing:**
- Time-based → Degree-based movement (battery-independent)
- Added color sensor verification at checkpoints
- Optimized turn sequences (saved 8 seconds total)
- Implemented continuous navigation (no stop-restart delays)
